Developing a RAG-based Query Suggestion Chatbot with Chain of Thought for WordPress Sites
1. Importing Necessary Libraries and Modules
  •	Warnings: For managing warning messages.
  •	LangChain: For loading datasets, text splitting, embedding, vector storage, and retrieval QA chains.
  •	Transformers: For tokenization, modeling, and pipeline creation.
  •	Requests: For making HTTP requests.
  •	Gradio: For creating a user interface.
2. WordPress API Loader
The WordPressAPILoader class is defined to fetch posts from a WordPress site.
  •	Initialization: Takes base_url and post_type (defaulting to 'posts') as parameters.
  •	Fetching Posts: fetch_posts method constructs the URL with the specified parameters and fetches posts using the WordPress REST API.
  •	Loading Posts: load method calls fetch_posts to retrieve the data.
3. Document Class
  •	Initialization: A simple class Document is defined to hold the content and metadata of each page.
4. Dataset Loading
  •	Dataset Specification: The dataset used is "databricks/databricks-dolly-15k".
  •	Loader Initialization: An instance of HuggingFaceDatasetLoader is created to load the dataset.
  •	Data Loading: The dataset is loaded into data.
5. Text Splitting
  •	Text Splitter Initialization: RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter is used to split the text into chunks of 1000 characters with a 150-character overlap.
  •	Document Splitting: The loaded dataset is split into documents.
6. Embedding and Vector Store
  •	Model Path: Specifies the path to the pre-trained model "sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-l6-v2".
  •	Model Configuration: Sets model configuration options to use CPU and not normalize embeddings.
  •	Embedding Initialization: An instance of HuggingFaceEmbeddings is created with the specified model and options.
  •	Vector Store Creation: A FAISS vector store is created from the documents and embeddings.
7. Question Answering Model
  •	Model and Tokenizer: Initializes tokenizer and model for question-answering using "Intel/dynamic_tinybert".
  •	Pipeline Definition: Defines a question-answering pipeline using the tokenizer and model.
  •	LLM Pipeline: Wraps the question-answering pipeline in a HuggingFacePipeline.
8. Retriever
  •	Retriever Creation: Creates a retriever object from the FAISS vector store.
  •	Search Configuration: Configures the retriever to return the top 4 most similar documents.
9. RetrievalQA Chain
  •	QA Chain Creation: Uses the RetrievalQA class to create a QA instance with the refine chain type.
10. WordPress Integration
  •	Loader Initialization: Creates an instance of WordPressAPILoader for the given base URL.
  •	Data Loading: Loads posts from the WordPress site.
  •	Document Conversion: Converts WordPress posts into Document objects.
  •	Text Splitting: Splits WordPress documents using the text splitter.
  •	Adding Documents: Adds the split WordPress documents to the FAISS vector store.
11. Query Processing Function
  •	Query Handling: Defines a function answer_question to process user queries:
  o	Search: Uses the FAISS vector store to search for similar documents.
  o	Context Creation: Combines the content of the search results to create a context.
  o	Question Answering: Uses the question-answering pipeline to find the answer based on the context.
12. User Interface with Gradio
  •	Interface Creation: Defines a Gradio interface for the chatbot.
  o	Function: Uses answer_question to handle inputs.
  o	Inputs/Outputs: Specifies text input and text output.
  o	Title/Description: Adds a title and description to the interface.
  •	Launching Interface: Launches the Gradio interface.
Summary
The overall strategy involves integrating multiple components to create a chatbot that can answer questions based on the content of documents retrieved from both a pre-defined dataset and a WordPress site. The approach leverages:
  •	Document Loading: Fetching and processing documents from different sources.
  •	Text Splitting: Breaking documents into manageable chunks.
  •	Embedding: Using pre-trained models to convert text into embeddings.
  •	Vector Storage and Retrieval: Storing embeddings in a FAISS vector store and retrieving similar documents based on queries.
  •	Question Answering: Using a refined question-answering pipeline to provide answers based on the context retrieved.
